    post: `Hospitals around the US are weighing the decision to move the information they store from servers they manage to the cloud.

    Tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all competing for the business, saying they can help hospitals manage and secure large amounts of patient information. For hospitals, the hope is that moving to the cloud would free them from having to invest in costly data centers, ultimately saving them money.

    But a recent scandal threatens to slow the move to the cloud. News broke in November that Google was quietly working with the second-largest health system in the US in a way that raised concerns about how much private health information the tech giant had access to and how it might use it.

    Already, some health systems have made the move to the cloud, turning to the tech giants for partnerships that extend beyond migrating data to the cloud.

    Take Rochester, Minnesota-headquartered Mayo Clinic.

    Mayo Clinic in September signed Google as its cloud and artificial-intelligence partner.

    Under the terms of the partnership, Mayo is moving the information it stores like patient records and imaging data into the cloud, and is working with Google on certain projects.

    "What we want to do is to have advanced data stored in ways that support analytics and clinical decision support," Cris Ross, Mayo's chief information officer, told Business Insider in November.

    Why Mayo chose Google
    Mayo Clinic CIO Cris Ross Courtesy Mayo Clinic Mayo said it put strict limits on Google's access to the data that the tech giant is handling as part of the agreement.

    "Google does not have access to our data outside those specific focused agreements," Ross said.

    In particular when setting up the partnership, the Mayo Clinic made it clear that the company would not have independent access to the data, and it wouldn't be able to combine the data it's accessing through its work with Mayo with other datasets.

    Ross said Mayo picked Google because of the "superiority of technology" the company has, as well as what the health system had heard about the tech giant's emerging Google Health business.

    As part of that work, Mayo in December hired on Dr. John Halamka, the former CIO at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to run its Mayo Clinic Platform, a portfolio of the health system's digital health initiatives.

    Halamka told Business Insider that there are three areas he's focusing on to start: helping to facilitate more hospital care done in the home via the platform, finding ways to use data for more preventive measures, and finding ways to make past patient data more useable by current patients looking to learn from those experiences.

    What other hospitals should keep in mind when moving to the cloud
    Cloud deals between tech giants and health systems are still in their early days, and what protections to put in place are still being figured out.

    Ross's advice to others navigating those contracts is to spend time setting up processes that make it clear when data can and can't be used. For instance, Mayo stipulated that Google can't have independent access to Mayo's data, and Mayo data can't be used by the company without the hospital's consent.

    As the deal was set up, Ross said, it was important to put in processes that made sure that the terms of the agreement could be monitored to prove that all parties were living up to the expectations set.

    Ross said that health systems shouldn't move to the cloud for the financial savings, alone. Investing in data centers is a costly process, then switching over to the cloud from those centers is another big investment.

    Ross said that Mayo hopes to to save money by moving to the cloud eventually.  But more importantly, he said the move to the cloud is more about making data available to use and draw from to benefit patients.`

    post: `Don't expect Amazon to follow companies like Google in changing its mind on military contracts. Jeff Bezos told guests at the Reagan National Defense Forum that the US is in "big trouble" if large tech companies are "turning their back" on the Defense Department. He further argued that Americans were "the good guys," and that it was imperative that the US maintained advantages over rivals in areas like spaceflight, where China appeared to be catching up.

    Bezos likewise made it clear that Amazon would continue to fight for more military business even after the Pentagon spurned it in favor of Microsoft for the JEDI contract. "We are going to support the Department of Defense, this country is important," he said.

    The tech pioneer isn't uniformly supportive of the government, and Amazon has accused the Defense Department of handing the JEDI contract to Microsoft due to President Trump's avowed anti-Amazon bias. Bezos is already steeped in public sector business, though, including contested facial recognition projects and long-term plans for Blue Origin to handle military rocket launches.

    His tone isn't that far off from Microsoft, which has defended its military contracts against employees who objected to their work being used for combat-related purposes. It suggests that there won't be much sympathy for critics in at least some bigger tech companies. These executives have firm agendas, and they expect their staff to follow through regardless of ethical concerns.`

    post: `During a joint press conference in London with President Emmanuel Macron of France this week, President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on French goods such as champagne, in retaliation for a new tax on large tech companies. As he spoke, Macron’s digital affairs minister, Cédric O, was in Washington, DC, trying to build support for even stronger actions against Google and other tech giants.

    “Tech platforms have a footprint in our economies and our democracies that is a huge challenge for public power,” O said, during a visit to WIRED’s offices in San Francisco, one stop on a week-long, cross-country trip that involved meeting lawmakers, regulators, and academics to discuss antitrust tactics. O says French and European ideas about restraining tech’s power are catching on in the US—and that France’s digital services tax is just the start.

    Macron signed that new levy into law in July. It takes 3 percent of digital sales from companies with more than €750 million ($829 million) in global revenue and revenues in France of over €25 million ($27 million) in categories such as online ads or ride hailing. Despite the ire it has drawn from tech companies and Trump’s US trade representative, O describes it as a kind of warmup.

    “The digital tax is politically and symbolically important, but from an economic and democratic point of view, it is a really, really small part of the problem,” O says. More important? Targeting the biggest tech companies—most of which are American—with new regulations to prevent them stifling competition and damaging democracy. “We’ve designed our regulatory framework for the industrial age, and at some point it’s not relevant any more,” O says.

    Unlike presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, O doesn’t want to break up tech companies. He instead quotes a slogan he says he heard this week from the man who used to be America’s top internet regulator, erstwhile Federal Communications Commission chair Tom Wheeler: “Don’t break them up, break them open.”

    O says that as with banks, governments could identify the “systemic” tech companies with the most power and target them with extra regulations. Those could include being forced to allow competitors access to their services or data for free or at controlled rates, a ban on acquisitions, and even specific hate-speech rules.

    “Tech platforms have a footprint in our economies and our democracies that is a huge challenge for public power.”

    Cédric O, France's Digital Affairs Minister

    Such ideas are unlikely to be popular with US tech companies or the top officials and tweeters of the Trump administration. But O claims that support for reforming antitrust rules to rein in tech is growing in the US, citing discussions he had this week with figures including Wheeler, Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who favors a government crackdown on tech firms, and Stanford economist Doug Melamed, formerly a top lawyer on the Justice Department’s antitrust case against Microsoft.

    The prospects of a significant US tech crackdown will be decided in November 2020. Regardless, O predicts an international assault, warning that the EU is poised to toughen its stance on the tech industry.

    The bloc recently appointed a fresh set of leaders to its executive branch, the EU Commission, which added a new position created specifically to work on “technological sovereignty”. It is filled by Denmark's Margrethe Vestager, who gained notoriety as the EU’s competition czar with investigations and fines of Google, Facebook, and Apple.

    O calls Vestager a “big ally” and predicts the EU will make “huge progress” on tech regulation in coming months. He also acknowledges that for Europe to truly change the trajectory of tech will require more than just government action—it also needs to incubate tech giants of its own.

    O laments that France has produced only a couple of tech IPOs larger than a billion euros in the past 23 years. “If you want to be able to set the standards in the world, you should be able to make new leaders emerge,” he says.

    The French government hopes new regulations can help change that by making it easier for startups to gain a foothold. It has a new €5 billion ($5.5 billion) fund for French startups. O says improved tech policies are already helping to inspire more French tech workers overseas to think about moving home—as did the recent electoral wins for Trump and Brexit.`
